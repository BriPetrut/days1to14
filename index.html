                <p>Inspiration source was those "secret message" puzzles you get in kid spy books. So that's what I was trying to re-create :)</p>

                <p>This came about by accdident after playing with motion. I realised that by adding blendMode() it created an interesting pattern.</p>

                <h3>Day 7</h3>
                <p>The inspiration source was animated optical illusions where a series of lines appear to animate when overlayed with a moving grid.</p>

                <h3>Day 8</h3>
                <p>Using a moving circle example from Compform's animation module, I experimented with it by changing the formulas. Then I added blendModes() again, to see how it would break it. Resulting in this interesting animation where you can see the steps.</p>

Then I added a random variable to the animation, to see how it would break it. Resulting in this interesting animation where it glitches. (or a "I had too much caffeine" effect)</p>

                <p>Taking a quick break to do a static sketch. I was inspired by 70's Bauhaus tones. I then overlaid the shapes using a grain texture I found on unsplash. </p>

                <p>I was taking a look at the libraries tab  in p5.js and saw one that was called p5.scribble. This is an experiment using that new library. Also used the translate() function in order to not redo all the imputs when it came to the second dash.
